In this project, I am going to create an entire web page from the design provided at the foundations project: landing page, the Odin project. I am going to make use of HTML, CSS, and the flexbox layout learned in the foundation course to lay out the web page. I have also learned about Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash which are good places to find free-to-use images in the web. I will be giving names and contact information here to credit the creators of the images I will be using in this project. Let's get to work!
